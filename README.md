# Automate-Accounting-Sheet
This program does the following:
<br>
--accesses my calendar and looks up my students for that day and retrieves them
<br>
--goes to my student finance/accounting sheet
<br>
--takes the name of the first student of the day and finds his/her finance sheet
<br>
--adds the meeting date and decrements the number of meeting credits by 1
<br>
--repeats this each day
